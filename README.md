# React + Material UI Learning Hub

This repository is dedicated to mastering both **React.js fundamentals** and **Material UI**.

## 🔧 What I Practice Here:

- React basics: Components, Props, useState, useEffect, Events
- Conditional rendering & list rendering
- Material UI components and theming
- Building small real-world mini-projects

## 📁 Structure:

- `basics/` — individual component demos and concepts
- `mini-projects/` — small apps like todo lists, login forms, etc.
